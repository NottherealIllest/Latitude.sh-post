#  Avalanche Node Guide - üì°

 
An Avalanche node is a network node that helps to maintain the Avalanche blockchain network. In this guide, we will discuss how to create an Avalanche node on [Latitude](https://Latitude.sh) 

  

##  Requirements

  

Before setting up the Avalanche node, ensure you have the following requirements:

- A computer with at least 16 GiB of RAM

- The equivalent of 8vCPU

- Storage: 1 TB

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12

- An internet connection with a minimum speed of 5 Mbps 

- Basic knowledge of the command line interface

  

This install script assumes:

  

- AvalancheGo is not running and is not already installed as a service

- The user running the script has superuser privileges (can run `sudo`)

  
##  Configuring your server.

### Create a Latitude account
You need to go to the Latitude website to create an account and pass KYC.

-   Create an account at [Latitude.sh](https://www.latitude.sh/dashboard/signup)
-   complete your KYC and add a payment method

### Create your server on the Latitude dashboard

Once you have your Latitude account setup it‚Äôs time to create a project to organize your servers. Give your project a name. The other fields are optional.

Now we are ready to configure and deploy your bare metal server! Click on `Servers` in the sidebar and the `Create server` button:

![Create a server](https://i.imgur.com/efHYdfN.png)



For an avalanche RPC node, the `c3.medium.x86`  or   `c2.medium.x86`  servers are recommended, however the`c1.medium.x86` could work, the server you need is largely dependent on your use case.

![c3.medium server](https://i.imgur.com/bBPGOP5.png)

If you do not see the server available, click on another location until it is listed under the `On demand` tab.
For this tutorial I am using A `c3.medium.x86`

Options:
![Configure your server](https://i.imgur.com/zFNtQAA.png)
-   `Operating System`: Select `Ubuntu 20.04`
-   All other settings are optional.

Once you are comfortable with your settings click the `Deploy ->` button. Depending on your configuration, deployment can be as fast as 30 seconds or up to 10 minutes.
![Server is deploying.](https://i.imgur.com/PJDnuFv.png)

After deployment is complete, click to enter the server save your IP address from your server dashboard, as well as other setting like Username and Password.

###  Access your server & further steps.
you can get your username and password from clicking into the server under your project.
If this is your first time running a node, to access your server, you need ssh client and terminal such as [Termius](https://termius.com/), once setup, Just click new host, then add the necessary credentials.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/jQSHSQT.png)

![Change your password](https://i.imgur.com/Mqj2vCQ.png)

Once your password has been changed and set, you are free to move on to the Installation section.

Remember üí°: Also unlike other chains where you have to install and update go-land all of those are bundled into the commands under `installation`.
They are also no separate steps for `state sync` or `archival nodes` you will be asked to choose what node while following the commands 

Note ‚úçüèΩ:
you can use the command below to check if your node is bootstrapped, as at the time of writing this tutorial it takes about 7 hours for a state `sync node` and about 3 weeks for an `archival node` ( dependent on the speed of your internet )
Once it returns true, your node is ready.

``` $bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.isBootstrapped",
    "params": {
        "chain":"X"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

##  Installation

  

Download the latest version of the Avalanche software from the official website.

  

```

wget -nd -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-docs/master/scripts/avalanchego-installer.sh;\

chmod 755 avalanchego-installer.sh;\

./avalanchego-installer.sh

```

  

The output should look something like this:

  

```

Unpacking node files...

avalanchego-v1.1.1/plugins/

avalanchego-v1.1.1/plugins/evm

avalanchego-v1.1.1/avalanchego

Node files unpacked into /home/ubuntu/avalanche-node

```

  

The script will prompt you for information about the network environment:

  

```

To complete the setup some networking information is needed.

Where is the node installed:

1) residential network (dynamic IP)

2) cloud provider (static IP)

Enter your connection type [1,2]:

```

  

enter `1`if you have dynamic IP, and `2`if you have a static IP. If you are on a static IP, it will try to auto-detect the IP and ask for confirmation.

  

```

Detected '3.15.152.14' as your public IP. Is this correct? [y,n]:

```

  

Confirm with `y`, or `n` if the detected IP is wrong (or empty), and then enter the correct IP at the next prompt.

  

Next, you have to set up RPC port access for your node. Those are used to query the node for its internal state, to send commands to the node, or to interact with the platform and its chains (sending transactions, for example). You will be prompted:

  

```

RPC port should be public (this is a public API node) or private (this is a validator)? [public, private]:

```

  

-  `private`: this setting only allows RPC requests from the node machine itself.

-  `public`: this setting exposes the RPC port to all network interfaces.

  

As this is a sensitive setting you will be asked to confirm if choosing `public`

. Please read the following note carefully:

  

> If you choose to allow RPC requests on any network interface you will need to set up a firewall to only let through RPC requests from known IP addresses, otherwise, your node will be accessible to anyone and might be overwhelmed by RPC calls from malicious actors! If you do not plan to use your node to send RPC calls remotely, enter `private`

.

>

  

The script will then prompt you to choose whether to enable state sync setting or not:

  

```

Do you want state sync bootstrapping to be turned on or off? [on, off]:

```

  

Turning state sync on will greatly increase the speed of bootstrapping, but will sync only the current network state. If you intend to use your node for accessing historical data (archival node) you should select `off`

. Otherwise, select `on`

. Validators can be bootstrapped with state sync turned on.

  

The script will then continue with system service creation and finish with starting the service:

  

```

Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/avalanchego.service ‚Üí /etc/systemd/system/avalanchego.service.

  

Done!

  

Your node should now be bootstrapping.

Node configuration file is /home/ubuntu/.avalanchego/configs/node.json

C-Chain configuration file is /home/ubuntu/.avalanchego/configs/chains/C/config.json

Plugin directory, for storing subnet VM binaries, is /home/ubuntu/.avalanchego/plugins

To check that the service is running use the following command (q to exit):

sudo systemctl status avalanchego

To follow the log use (ctrl-c to stop):

sudo journalctl -u avalanchego -f

  

Reach us over on https://chat.avax.network if you're having problems.

```

  

The script is finished, and you should see the system prompt again.

  

###  **Post Installation**

  

AvalancheGo should be running in the background as a service. You can check that it's running with:

  

```

sudo systemctl status avalanchego

```

  

This will print the node's latest logs, which should look like this:

  

```

```

  

Note the `active (running)` which indicates the service is running OK. You may need to press `q` to return to the command prompt.

  

To find out your NodeID, which is used to identify your node to the network, run the following command:

  

```

sudo journalctl -u avalanchego | grep "NodeID"

```

  

It will produce output like:

  

```

Jan 05 10:38:38 ip-172-31-30-64 avalanchego[2142]: INFO [01-05|10:38:38] avalanchego/node/node.go#428: Set node's ID to 6seStrauyCnVV7NEVwRbfaT9B6EnXEzfY

```

  

Prepend `NodeID-` to the value to get, for example, `NodeID-6seStrauyCnVV7NEVwRbfaT9B6EnXEzfY`. Store that; it will be needed for staking or looking up your node.

  

Your node should be in the process of bootstrapping now. You can monitor the progress by issuing the following command:

  

```

sudo journalctl -u avalanchego -f

```

  

Press `ctrl+C` when you wish to stop reading node output.

  

##  Stopping the Node[](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/set-up-node-with-installer#stopping-the-node)

  

To stop AvalancheGo, run:

  

```

sudo systemctl stop avalanchego

  

```

  

To start it again, run:

  

```

sudo systemctl start avalanchego

  

```

  

##  Node Upgrade[](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/set-up-node-with-installer#node-upgrade)

  

AvalancheGo is an ongoing project and there are regular version upgrades. Most upgrades are recommended but not required. Advance notice will be given for upgrades that are not backward compatible. When a new version of the node is released, you will notice log lines like:

  

```

Jan 08 10:26:45 ip-172-31-16-229 avalanchego[6335]: INFO [01-08|10:26:45] avalanchego/network/peer.go#526: beacon 9CkG9MBNavnw7EVSRsuFr7ws9gascDQy3 attempting to connect with newer version avalanche/1.1.1. You may want to update your client

  

```

  

It is recommended to always upgrade to the latest version because new versions bring bug fixes, new features, and upgrades.

  

To upgrade your node, just run the installer script again:

  

```

./avalanchego-installer.sh

  

```

  

It will detect that you already have AvalancheGo installed:

  

```

AvalancheGo installer

---------------------

Preparing environment...

Found 64bit Intel/AMD architecture...

Found AvalancheGo systemd service already installed, switching to upgrade mode.

Stopping service...

  

```

  

It will then upgrade your node to the latest version, and after it's done, start the node back up, and print out the information about the latest version:

  

```

Node upgraded, starting service...

New node version:

avalanche/1.1.1 [network=mainnet, database=v1.0.0, commit=f76f1fd5f99736cf468413bbac158d6626f712d2]
